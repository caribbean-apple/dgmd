          for (const win of winConditions) {
            tile = moves[win[0]];
            if (tile === '-') continue;
            if (tile !== moves[win[1]]) continue;
            if (tile !== moves[win[2]]) continue;
	    ...
          }

I like the snippet above. At first I used winConditions.forEach, but I realized that you can't use continue and break. You can use return instead of continue, but I found this easily confusable with making the function return. I learned online about for..of, and I think it's nicer for this use case.
