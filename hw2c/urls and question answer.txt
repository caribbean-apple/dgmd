Answer to question: Identify an area of JS code in the final solution (ttt5) you feel really good about â€“ and indicate why.

          for (const win of winConditions) {
            const tiles = moves[win[0]] + moves[win[1]] + moves[win[2]];
            if (tiles === "XXX"){
              winningTile = 'X';
            }
            else if (tiles === "OOO") {
              winningTile = 'O'
            }
            else {
              continue;
            }
	    ...

I like the snippet above. At first I used winConditions.forEach, but I realized that you can't use continue and break. You can use return instead of continue, but I found this easily confusable with making the function return. I learned online about for..of, and I think it's nicer for this use case.
