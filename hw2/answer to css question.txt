It's in the javascript block, but it's technically css code.

I liked the selector for the boxes to fill x's and o's:

'.container > .square:nth-of-type(5)'

I had to read a bit about this. At first I wasn't sure if it would take the 5th .square overall, if it is a direct child of a container, or if it would take the 5th square of those which are direct children of a .container.

The answer is the latter. That means that the expression must be evaluated as if it had the parenthesis here:

'(.container > .square):nth-of-type(5)'
