Questions answered:
1.	Of the object variations we have learned, which feels the most useful to you?
I wouldn't say one is more useful than the other, they just have different use cases. Object literals are best for one-off, simple objects. Classes are best if you want the functionality of a constructor, instancing, and inheritance.

2.	What was the easiest part of this assignment?
I don't think any of the parts were difficult on their own but the sum total of all of them took time.
You could say that writing the HTML file was the easiest part because most of the work is in the js file.
