  <h1>Hello World! My name is Felix</h1>
  <p>I grew up in New York City. I don't really have a major! I'm taking whatever classes it takes to make websites and start a business around that. However I'll be following some of the Digital Media Design track and let's see where things go.</p>
  
  <h2>Web Development Background</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>I started messing around with HTML and CSS when I was 11 or 12, but never did anything back-end and never used a front-end framework.</li>
    <li>This past summer, I took CSCI-S33A, which was a great intro to back-end web development. Now I'm ready for more.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Software Development Background</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>I first used Python for physics simulations, and got a minor in CS.</li>
    <li>Then I worked as a Data Scientist.</li>
    <li>Last semester, I learned back-end web development with Django.</li>
    <li>But I never properly learned front-end webdev beyond the very basics. So now I'm here!</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    But <b>WHY</b> am I here?
  </p>
  <p> I am starting an entrepreneurial part of my life. I want to make a bunch of websites and see if any of them stick. I've also been learning accounting, startup finance and investments, and other stuff that will help me greatly in this journey.</p>

  <h2>My favorite place</h2>

  <p>I'd be lying to you if I said I really even HAD a favorite place. But this is my living room which I worked really hard on. It's great for having people over for a party or just staring out the window.</p>
  <h2>Favorite Restaurant:</h2>
  <p>If you're hungry and you want a simple family-style restaurant that makes you feel at home, definitely check out <a href="https://www.maggianos.com/locations/massachusetts/boston/4-columbus-ave./?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=Maggianos" target="_blank">Maggiano's</a>. It's right next to Boston Common!</p>
  


<p>That's all, folks! </p>
