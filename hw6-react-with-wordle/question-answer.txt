Answer to the question:  
Which seems better for creating the elements of the app:  JS alone or JS with React?
So far, JS alone seems easier. But I appreciate the flexibility you get from creating variable components. I think that once we start with JSX things will ramp up in favor of React. That will be even more true for bigger projects.

In class it was mentioned that we don't need to host online, but in the word doc it says to host online so I'm just going ahead with it.
