Question Answer:
What are a) the most interesting and b) the most surprising Javascript constructs we have learned in the past few weeks.

a) Most interesting was the use of the spread operator to make a function with variably many arguments

myfunc = function (...myArgs) {
  console.log(myArgs[0], myArgs[1]);
}

b) Most surprising was that array sort sorts as a string even if all elements are numbers, so you have to use a comparison function to sort numbers

const numbers = [100,1,2,3];
numbers.sort((a,b) => a - b);
